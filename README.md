Since 2023, I serve as main instructor for an undergraduate class of Econometrics at [DII - Universidad de Chile](https://www.dii.uchile.cl/english/).<br>

Previously, I was TA for introductory, intermediate and advanced courses in microeconomics and macroeconomics at the [Economics Department](https://econ.uchile.cl).<br>

Even though I had the chance to take classes with amazing economics professors both at UChile and UPF, my main inspiration for my teaching activities is my mom, who works at the hospital school at [Calvo Mackenna's Hospital](https://calvomackenna.cl/comunidad_amigable/colegio_hospitalario) in Santiago de Chile.
