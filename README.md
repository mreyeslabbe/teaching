Since 2023, I have served as the main instructor for an undergraduate class in Econometrics at <a href = "https://www.dii.uchile.cl/english/"> DII - Universidad de Chile</a>. Additionally, I have been a member of the examining committee for master's theses in the <a href = "https://www.magcea-uchile.cl/"> MAGCEA</a> program within the same department.</p>

<p align="justify">
Previously, I was TA for introductory, intermediate and advanced courses in microeconomics and macroeconomics at the <a href = "https://econ.uchile.cl"> Economics Department </a> of Universidad de Chile.<br></p>

Even though I had the unbelievable opportunity to take classes with amazing economics professors both at UChile and UPF, my main inspiration for my teaching activities is my mom, who works at the hospital school at <a href = "https://calvomackenna.cl/comunidad_amigable/colegio_hospitalario">Calvo Mackenna's Hospital</a> in Santiago de Chile. </p>
